Below is my interactive dashboard about bike sales! This was a practice project using a publicly avaialble dataset about bike buyers.

It breaks down average income per purchase, age vs. bike sale, and customer commute vs. bike sale. 

There are also some filters to see how marital status, region, and education stack up against the baseline.
