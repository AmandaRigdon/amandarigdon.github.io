# My Data Journey

I have been working with data in one way or another since I was around 16. Whether it was helping my dad do book-keeping for the apartment complex he managed, or helping recruiters sift through swaths of candidates, data management was ever present in all of my jobs. Back in 2018, I got the opportunity to move up to Napa to pursue a job as a Wine Information Analyst. It's a very niche but important position that our winemakers like to call "the wine police." We track and maintain data related to winemaking all the way until it goes into bottle. We also ensure the data has integrity and is complaint to the TTB standards (that's where the "police" part comes in). While I love my job, I figured it was time for a change, which is when I heard about the Google Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera. I soon found out that data analytics was very different from my current job, but there were already a lot of things that I do currently that line up with what I learned! I'm hoping to take what I know and what I have learned and apply it to a future data analytics job that will help me grow.
