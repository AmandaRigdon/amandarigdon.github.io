## About

Hello and welcome to my portfolio! 

With my current job as a wine information analyst, I already have some experience in data analysis, specifically regarding data cleaning, data integrity, and communication. I'm hoping to use these skills along with the new skills I have learned from the Google Data Analytics course to expand my horizons.

Technical Skills:

* *SQL*
* *R*
* *Tableau*
* *Excel*
